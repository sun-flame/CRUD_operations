🚀 Successfully Completed Task 3: Building a CRUD API! 🔥

I'm excited to share that I have completed Task 3, where I built a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB! 🎯

💡 Key Features:
✅ Created API endpoints to add new users 📌
✅ Fetched all users & filtered users based on queries 🔍
✅ Updated user details dynamically ✏️
✅ Deleted users from the database ❌
✅ Used Mongoose for seamless database interactions 🔗
✅ Tested API with Postman & MongoDB Compass 🛠

It was a great learning experience in RESTful APIs, database handling, and Express routing. 💪

✨ Looking forward to diving into more backend development challenges! 🚀
